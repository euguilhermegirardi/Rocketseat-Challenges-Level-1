## :rocket: About the challenge

In this challenge, I must plan my studies.

For that, I had to create a chronogram that will be adapted according to my time and rhythm.

Define what'll be my study schedule, creating tasks that will be attached to a calendar, to help me study and always be aligned with my goals!
